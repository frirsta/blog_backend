# Project Management

I have used Github issues and Github project board for project management.

### Agile methodology

- **Must Have** - Are the issues that have to be top priority.
- **Should have** - Are second priority.
- **Could have** - Third priority.
- **Won't have** - Will not be in the project.

  The Won't have label is for long term use in the project and has not been

# JWT Authentication

The project uses JWT-based authentication to manage user sessions. This is implemented using Django REST Framework SimpleJWT, but with enhanced customizations to ensure security and proper user management.

### Key Customizations:

1. Custom JWT Authentication Class

- A custom CustomJWTAuthentication class that extends the default JWTAuthentication from SimpleJWT.
- This class checks if the user associated with the token is active before granting access.
- If a user account is disabled, a 403 PermissionDenied error is returned with the message "User account is disabled."

2. Active User Check (IsActiveUser Permission)

- A custom permission class `IsActiveUser` ensures that only active users can access the API endpoints protected by this permission.
- This provides an additional layer of protection, even if the userâ€™s token is valid but the account has been deactivated.

#### Configuration

In settings.py, the authentication and permission classes have been updated as follows:

```python
 REST_FRAMEWORK = {

    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'blog.authentication.CustomJWTAuthentication',
    ),
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
        'blog.permissions.IsActiveUser',
    ),

}
```

##### Custom Classes

- CustomJWTAuthentication:
- Located in blog/authentication.py.
- Overrides get_user method to check if the user is active.

```python
from rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication import JWTAuthentication
from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied

class CustomJWTAuthentication(JWTAuthentication):
    def get_user(self, validated_token):
        user = super().get_user(validated_token)
        if not user.is_active:
            raise PermissionDenied("User account is disabled.")
        return user
```

##### IsActiveUser Permission:

- Located in blog/permissions.py.
- Ensures the request is made by an active user.

```python
from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied
from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission

class IsActiveUser(BasePermission):
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        if not request.user.is_active:
            raise PermissionDenied("User account is disabled.")
        return True
```

#### Updated Registration Flow

- During user registration, the backend no longer issues tokens directly using the `for_user` method due to a security vulnerability in versions of `djangorestframework-simplejwt` <= 5.3.1.
- Users register through the `/profiles/register/` endpoint, and the frontend handles logging in the user separately after a successful registration by making a login request to obtain JWT tokens.

# Testing

### Testing the Enhanced Authentication Flow

This section verifies that the enhanced authentication system handles both active and inactive users correctly, and that the logout functionality behaves as expected.

#### Prerequisites:

- You must have a valid access token (`<your_access_token>`) and refresh token (`<your_refresh_token>`).

1. **Scenario 1: Active User Access:**

   - Verify that the user account is active (user.is_active = True).
   - Send a request to the protected endpoint:

     ```bash
     curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/current-user/ \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>"
     ```

   - The response should return the user details as expected:

     ```json
     {
       "id": 11,
       "username": "testuser",
       "email": "",
       "profile_picture": "http://...",
       "cover_picture": "http://...",
       "bio": null,
       "location": null,
       "website": null,
       "first_name": "",
       "last_name": ""
     }
     ```

2. **Scenario 2: Inactive User Access:**

   - Mark the user account as inactive in the Django shell:

     ```python
     user = User.objects.get(username="testuser")
     user.is_active = False
     user.save()
     ```

   - Send the same request as above.
   - The response should indicate that the user is inactive:

     ```json
     {
       "detail": "User account is disabled.",
       "code": "user_inactive"
     }
     ```

3. **Scenario 3: Successful Logout:**

   - Ensure an active user can successfully log out:

     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/logout/ \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>" \
     -d '{"refresh": "<your_refresh_token>"}'
     ```

   - The response should confirm successful logout:

     ```json
     {
       "detail": "Successfully logged out."
     }
     ```

4. **Scenario 4: Logout Attempt by Inactive User:**

   - Try logging out with an inactive userâ€™s refresh token:

     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/logout/ \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>" \
     -d '{"refresh": "<your_refresh_token>"}'
     ```

   - The response should indicate that the user account is disabled:

     ```json
     {
       "detail": "User account is disabled."
     }
     ```

> Note: If any unexpected issues occur during testing, ensure that the backend server is running, and the tokens are valid and not expired.

### Removing Vulnerable Code

- Security Update: The vulnerable `for_user` method was removed to avoid potential information disclosure vulnerabilities. The login flow now uses a separate request made from the frontend, which ensures that inactive users cannot access system resources with JWT tokens.
